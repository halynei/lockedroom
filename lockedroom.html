  <h1>Locked Room</h1>
  <p>I'm lying here, lifeless,
in the corner of my cell,
rotting in the mess,
I've made and known so well.

One time, a storm came, one of many,
along with the mind getting bleak and weary,
I witnessed a thunder pierce right through the window,
the wind rushed inside and whispered: "Flee, flee to the meadow!"

I crawled outside, through the broken glass,
in the middle of the field I fell and let the hours pass,
remains of the transparent wall torn up all the closed cuts,
and through them, the acid rain poured inside, dissolving my guts.

And I waited for the goddamn Sun,
for it to reveal my overcoming; that I won.
Then I stood up, nearly blind and sore,
only to realise there's no one around anymore.

The triumph was never meant to last long -
I got striked by the wind that came back so strong.
Knocked out, I got dragged back to the locked room,
after a while woken up by a familiar, filthy odor of doom.

Now I'm one with the darkness
in the corner of my cell,
intertwined with the mess
I've made and known so well.
