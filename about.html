<div class="content">
    <p>Some might question the necessity of running independent websites such as this, especially in the age of all-consuming, ever-expanding social media. Even though the last decade dominated by platforms from the category I've mentioned earlier has offered us the opportunity to reach the numbers of people we've never even thought of before, I still see the sense in bringing your own corner in the web to life.</p>
    
<br>

    <p>With the closure of Geocities (which I consider an important pinpoint on Internet's timeline and one of the final nails in the coffin of its golden days) even more people, especially those, who thrived in this realm of self-expression and engaging with others in a non-synthetic environment, started being pushed from one place to another by companies set on monetizing every single platform that allowed for the creation of personal spaces, leading to these platforms' literal death. These acts of pure greed stripped the whole web of accessible, (in various meanings of this word) free, and stable places that allowed our creativity and individualism to flourish.</p>
    
<br>

    <p>Instead, we're left with tasteless, hermetic mass media platforms which, of course, opened us the door to widespread content, but to me, these numbers without proper expression of oneself are truly worthless. Social media pushes its users to become a copy of an already copied concept; there's no room left (and it was never intended to reserve it) for unconventionality.</p>
    
<br>

    <p>And so I began sculpting the Frankenstein of websites in March of 2024 using a notepad app, with the help of various tools and tutorials on the Internet. The purpose of this site is to provide a clear, safe and independent board which I can use to hang my works on the way I want them to be viewed, and not the way a group of a hundred random web designers from California tells me to. This proto-gallery is, of course, under constant development and what you see here is just the beginning of what will come next. I've always dreamed of having my own place where I can leave sort of a record of myself since acknowledging the greater opportunities awaiting on the Internet... oh, to be that six-year-old discovering GIFs and Flash games again.</p>
